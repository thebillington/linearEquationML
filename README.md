# linearEquationML
A repository to hold a basic TensorFlow program that can solve linear equations using ML

# How it works
This is a super simple program that takes in a number of x and y coordinates and then uses an optimizer to find suitable values for the gradient and y intercept of a line with equation y = mx + c, that satisfies the given coordinates

# Learning
I learned how to create this program from slides in a lecture by Brian Sletten at Devoxx Polan 2017. I do not have a background in machine learning and I wouldn't be able to apply the basics without having code that already solved the problem provided
